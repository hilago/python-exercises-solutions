List Less Than Ten 

Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

Instead of printing the elements one by one,
make a new list that has all the elements less than 5
from this list in it and print out this new list.
Write this in one line of Python.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements
from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.


----Solution----


def less_than_5(a):
 for num in a:
    if num<5:
        print(num)

----Extras----

def less_than_5_extra(a):
 print([num for num in a if num < 5])
 
def less_than_num(a):
  num=(int(input("choose a number: ")))
  print([n for n in a if n<num])
