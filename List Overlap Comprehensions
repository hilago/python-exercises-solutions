RACTICE PYTHON

Take two lists, say for example these two:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only
the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes

Extras:

Randomly generate two lists to test this

----Solution----

f i r st   w a y:

def List_Overlap(a,b):
    #c would temporarily hold the list with the duplicates
    #new_list would be the final list(list c with no duplicates)
 c=[]
 new_list=[]
 for n in a:
    if n in b:
        c.append(n)
 for n in c:
    if n not in new_list:
        new_list.append(n)
 return new_list
 
 

 s e c o n d   w a y:
 
 def List_Overlap(a,b):
    new_list=list(set([n for n in a if n in b]))
    return new_list
 
 
 	
----Extras----

import random

a = random.sample (range(1,99),random.randrange(1,20))
b = random.sample (range(1,99),random.randrange(1,20))
