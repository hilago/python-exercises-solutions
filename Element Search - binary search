Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers
(a list where the elements are in order from smallest to largest)
and another number.
The function decides whether or not the given number is
inside the list and returns (then prints) an appropriate boolean.

Extras:

Use binary search.

def is_in(nums, num):
    return num in nums
	
	
	
	or

	

def for_search(nums,num):
    for n in nums:
        if n == num:
            return True
    return False

def binary_search(nums,num):
    first = 0
    last =len(nums)-1
    found = False


    while first <= last and not found:
        mid = (first + last)//2
        if nums[mid] == num:
            found = True
        else:
            if num < nums[mid]:
                last = mid - 1
            else:
                first = mid +1

    return found
