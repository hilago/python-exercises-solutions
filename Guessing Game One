Guessing Game One

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).
Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low,
too high, or exactly right.
(Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

Extras:

Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

----Solution----

import random

computer_random_num =random.randint(1,9)

ueser_guess = int(input("what is your guss: "))

if ueser_guess > computer_random_num:
    print("your guess is too high")
if ueser_guess < computer_random_num:
    print("your guess is too low")
if ueser_guess == computer_random_num:
    print("your guess is right!!!!")
	
----Extras----
import random

def guessing_game():
    computer_random_num = random.randint(1, 9)
    count = 1
    ueser_guess=0
    while  ueser_guess != "exit" and ueser_guess != computer_random_num:
     ueser_guess = input("what is your guss: ")

     if ueser_guess == "exit":
        break

     ueser_guess = int(ueser_guess)

     if ueser_guess > computer_random_num:
        print("your guess is too high")
        count += 1

     if ueser_guess < computer_random_num:
        print("your guess is too low")
        count += 1

     if ueser_guess == computer_random_num:
        print("your guess is right!!!!")
    
    return f"it took you {count} times to guess right"
