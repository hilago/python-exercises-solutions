Odd Or Even 

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
print out an appropriate message to the user.
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

1.If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.

2.Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check).
  If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user.
  If not, print a different appropriate message.


----Solution----

num = int(input("choose a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("the number is an even number")
else:
    print("the number is an odd number")


----Extras----
if num1 % 4 == 0:
   print("the number is an even number and a multiple of 4")

num = (int(input("choose a number:")))
check = (int(input("choose a second number:")))
if num % check == 0:
   print("divides evenly")
else:
   print("does not divides evenly")
