List Overlap

Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between
the lists (without duplicates).
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:

1.Randomly generate two lists to test this

2.Write this in one line of Python


----Solution----

def no_duplicates(a,b):
    return list(set([n for n in a if n in a and n in b]))

print(no_duplicates(a,b))


----Extras----



import random

first_list_len = random.randrange(1,20)
second_list_len = random.randrange(1,20)

a=[]
b=[]

for n in range(first_list_len):
    a.append(random.randrange(1,100))
for n in range(second_list_len):
    b.append(random.randrange(1,100))
