Divisors 


Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


----Solution----

user_num = int(input("choose an number: "))
print([n for n in range(1,user_num+1) if user_num % n == 0])
